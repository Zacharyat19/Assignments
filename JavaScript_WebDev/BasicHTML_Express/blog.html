        <ol>
            <li>The most challenging part of this assignment was trying to make the handlebars templates and serving a single twit. I didnâ€™t know that express parameters were strings and I had to figure out how to convert them to ints.</li>
            <li>I learned how to use both express and handlebars together. I have never used either of them and it was really interesting how you can take parts of html and stick them together like layers. </li>
            <li>The class lecture was really helpful with getting started and figuring out what the basic components of handlebars and express were. I used w3schools and MDN to find documentation for specific functions that I needed for the single twit.</li>
            <li>I had to google how to turn strings into ints in javascript. I found the parseInt function was good then I had to google another function to make sure the new int was actually an int.</li>
