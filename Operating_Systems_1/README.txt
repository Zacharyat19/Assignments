How to run:
    The program is compiled with (gcc --std=gnu99 -o movies main.c)
    This will create a movies executable that can run as (./movies *csv file name*)
    Will run with valgrind as (valgrind ./movies *csv file name*)
Note:
    Comment syntax is similar to the one used in CS261. Functions 2 and 3 implemented with help from TA
