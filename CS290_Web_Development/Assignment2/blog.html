            <li>The most challenging part of this assignment was making sure all the pieces were formatted correctly. 
                For instance my navbar elements didn’t fit inside their rectangle and the flex boxes had two pieces in the center 
                instead of being flush on the left margin.</li>
            <li>I have never done CSS before so everything I did in this assignment was new to me. 
                I thought it was pretty cool working with the flex boxes since they can realign themselves when the page decreases in size.</li>
            <li>The class lectures helped when I wanted to find a specific attribute for an element like how flex boxes worked or how to use the hover feature. 
                When I needed help for an attribute we didn’t go over in class I used w3schools to find what it was I needed.</li>
            <li>Two things I had to google for this assignment were related to the flex boxes and buttons. 
                For flex boxes I googled the different line spacing features for both the horizontal and vertical axis. 
                For buttons I had to search how to change their sizes and borders.</li>          
        </ol>
