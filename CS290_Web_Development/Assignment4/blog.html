        <ol>
            <li>The most challenging part of this assignment was finding the errors that occurred. I had the pages loading but they were missing content and it was because of my url paths.</li>
            <li>I have worked with some node.js before but not to the level of this assignment. I learned how to create the server and how to load the pages based on requests.</li>
            <li>I mostly used the two class lectures for this assignment. I had no need for any outside resources.</li>
            <li>I didnâ€™t have to google anything for this assignment. If I did, it would  be related to handling http requests or node functions.</li>
