        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I didn't face many difficult challenges during this assignment becuase of its simplicity. The only problem I had was remembering how to use HTML and finding the best format for the assignment</li>
            <li>Since I took some HTML back in high school, all this was pretty much a review to me. The only thing I really forgot was the formating on the image tag which I had to look up</li>
            <li>I only had to use a outside resource when formating the image tag since my picture was too large. I used the W3Schools website for this.</li>
