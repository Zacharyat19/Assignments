        <ol>
            <li>I had a really hard time trying to get the live search to work. I eventually figured out I needed to use a forEach loop and had to learn how it worked in the given situation.</li>
            <li>I have never used javascript before so everything in this assignment was new to me. I had an insight when learning how to use the event listener functions and how I can create my own version of them.</li>
            <li>I used a variety of resources for this assignment. I used the class lectures when trying to make a new twit since we basically covered how to do that in class. I also used w3schools when looking for syntax and how to use certain functions.</li>
            <li>There were two things I had to google for this assignment. The first one was how to use the forEach loop because I wasnâ€™t sure about the syntax. The second one was how to create my own functions to use within the event listeners.</li>
