# Portfolio
A collection of projects and assignments throughout college to demonstrate mastery and skill in various languages including C, C++, Python, and Javascript.

### Projects of interest
There are a few projects that stand out from the others that I am particularly proud of.

1. Small_Linux_Shell: A simple shell that can run in a UNIX environment that is capable of running commands such as ls, pwd, or cat. The shell can execute its built in command, external commands via the PATH, redirect input & output, execute commands as foreground or background, and interact with the SIGINT/SIGTSTP signals. Can be found in C_Projects.
2. OOP_ZooTycoon: A simple implementation of the classic zoo tycoon game using object orientated programming. Allows the player to purchase, feed, and sell animals. Can be found in C++_Projects.
3. The Javascript folder demonstrates the design process of building a simple website in various stages including the HTML skeleton, adding CSS styling, implementing user interactions via Javascript, and delivering data via NodeJs.
